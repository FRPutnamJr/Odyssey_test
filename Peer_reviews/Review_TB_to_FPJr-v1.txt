Review Notes on /Odyssey_test/blob/master/Odyssey-Software_Requirements_Specifications.pdf
Section 1.6 
item 3 Link appears broken, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplaction should be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication 
i think the same issue exists on the repository readme

Section 2.1
second paragraph
The class will provide
Unit tests are included as part of the development.

Section 2.6
could there be a set for multiple matrix elements, ie you have a 3x3 matrix and set the elements at 1x1 to 2x2 with a 2x2 matrix 
What  about getting a  submatrix
What sort of protections  will be in  place for the matrix operations (checking dimensions of the input matrices,unit types etc)
Which operations will be functions and which functions will be overloaded operators(ie: how would i apply a scalar to the matrix, or multiply two matrices together?)
Would I be able combine matrices, either by an append or concatenante function or by using the two submatrices as inputs to initialize a new matrix.
How will it handle mixed unit type matrix operations? 
Will there be get functions to read the dimensions of the matrix? how will a user know the size of the matrix.

Overall notes/questions
What happens if you send a unit type that isn't supported(such as a string or other complex data types)
Will the set/get functions detect inappopriate data types for the matrix(ie, calling the .set function of a int matrix with a floating point value)
Can i set the entire matrix at once?
What values are the matrix elements initialized to?
Will the class have additional constructors, for example to allow setting all of the matrix elements or combining matrices into a new matrix.
will i be able to cast the matrix as a different unit type(or retrieve a floating point or integer version of a matrix)
How will the matrix elements be stored? in an array, linked list, database, etc.

Odyssey_test/blob/master/Software_Unit_Tests.pdf
What if not all arguments of the constructor are sent, ie only one argument

what unit type are the arguments of the constructor?
What if i call the contstructor with the arguments 1.7, 17.8 and FLOAT_TYPE

what if i get or set an invalid index ie: set(1.7,1.9,false)

I think there needs to be more unit tests defined, what function is being called, what are the arguments, what range of values will be tested as input, etc. 
How will it validate that the result of the operation is successful.

UT7 the input line isn't aligned
